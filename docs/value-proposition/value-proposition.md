## [The problem]

SAVE TIME; MAKE TIME Planning events with a large number of participants often leads to frustration and increased time expenditure due to suboptimal tools. In order to optimize these possibilities and expand current calendar functions, GIO wants to give the user the pleasure of implementing demanding plans again through aesthetics in combination with usability. The GIO application enables the user to communicate availabilities more quickly and schedule more flexibly. This results in GIO's slogan: "Save time; make time".

## [Our solution]

In the digitalization process of our everyday lives, we are constantly on the lookout for new lifestyle products that add to our convenience. There is not only a faster adoption rate, but also a higher demand from consumers for customized digital solutions. Agile organization helps us to maintain an overview and manage our daily lives in a rapidly changing world. The relevance of GIO (Giờ = Vietnamese for hour or time) can be measured by its adaptation to today's trends towards individualization, smart services and connectivity.

The fundamental key-function of the GIO application will be the sharing of available time slots with peers via a week-to-week overview and classic interaction including a to-do list and a commentary option.

## [Target user]

GIO's main target audience is someone with standard to high technical affinity. Please refer to the Persona descriptions below for a detailed look into GIO's target users.

● User connects with friends and can see “available” time blocks from them.
● User can create an “event” time block and suggest it to friends. User and friends can specify time blocks with a title, a list and comments.
