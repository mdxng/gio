## 01: First impressions

### Meta

Status
: Work in progress - **Done** - Obsolete

Updated
: 27-12-2023

Carried out by
: Dao Minh Duong Nguyen

### Goal

Finding out intuitive user behavior of the app and unnecessary or needed functionalities

### Method

1. Gather a group of people around a table, where you can display the application \(in this case, a Christmas dinner with friends).
2. Shortly introduce the idea. 
3. Click through the application or let people navigate through it themselves.
4. Let them give feedback (this way you can get an honest first impression).
5. Then actively ask questions.

[Disclaimer: This was not an official user evaluation in the sense of research. Uni topics casually came up as a dinner topic, so I just quickly showed my friends the application. Talking about it resulted in good insights but also since it was in a comfortable manner, the feedback wasn't forced]

### Results

- It would be nice to have individual overviews of events for each user.
- If it's possible the option of suggestion/alternative dates would be useful, as it is quiet common to switch dates.
- "What if I don't want everyone to know I'm free on Day X. Only a specific group of people?"
- Overall, the intentions of the app and the look was well received.  

### Implications

- We aim to add another sub page "My Events". (To Do)
- While we would like to add alternative date suggestions, we don't find it completely necessary at this moment. The workaround currently is using the comment section to simply comment an alternative date and then a separate/ new event can be created. (No To Do Yet)
- A filter function or grouping function is a great idea, but for now will not be implemented due to complexity. (No To Do Yet)

## 02: User Interview

### Meta

Status
: Work in progress - **Done** - Obsolete

Updated
: 08-02-2024

Carried out by
: Dao Minh Duong Nguyen

### Goal

Would GIO be actually used and what does it take to get there? 

### Method

This is a 1:1 interview but feel free to make a group discussion. Explain/demonstrate the application and then ask questions. To keep the conversation flowing, I recommend recording instead of taking notes.

The person I interviewed was a friend, having a ton of apps already downloaded on the phone. He is a spontaneous, social butterfly, but not really the planner himself (doesn't use calendar apps). 

Here are the questions I asked concerning GIO: 
1. Would you use this app if you heard about it from me (not as the maker) or one of our friends? 
2. What do you like about it?
3. What makes it better than how you plan meetings with your friends currently?
4. Would you actually use this to plan your meetings with friends?
5. Would you recommend this app to other people?
6. What is the app missing?

[FYI: This was an in person interview. However, I can recommend using a Google form if you need to reach a wider audience. The form will help you see trends/ majority votes more easily. Since I knew this person privately, I have an idea of their character and phone usage - I can only recommend having basic questions (Do you like trying out new apps?) as well, to have more in-depth results.]

### Results

The interview was in German, so this is a translated and also shortened version. 

1. "Yeah, if somebody sends me the link or plans something via the app, I would try it out. If it's free." 
2. "It looks simple. I like it. Is it only in English?"
3. "It's all in one space. It'd be a better overview. Do I get notifications? Is there an app version?" 
4. "Yeah, I can see myself using it. I can see my friends using it too. But not if I have to to log into it all the time, or have to use my laptop for it. On my phone, yes."
5. "Yeah, I mean it looks nice and I think it's useful. Not sure if I would actively use it myself. But I'd recommend it to people who I know plan a lot." 
6.  "An App I can download. [And the web version?] Not sure, maybe a way to change colors or so"

### Implications

- German version (or language version depending on main user base)
- Notifications of changes 
- Quick login via Cookies
- Share Option 
- Personalization (via color options)

These are great task items, which we unfortunately cannot implement in the project scope due to time constraints.
