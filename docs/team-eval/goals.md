## Our Kanban Board

We used the project environment of GitHub to organize our work.

### Goals achieved

We achieved the baseline of our goals, which means that we have created the look, made relevant decisions, conducted user research in form of persona and interview and held our presentation. The web application GIO can be run and our thought process is sufficiently documented in GitPages.

### Goals missed

We clearly underperformed concerning the necessary steps to make a viable product. Because of our bad time management especially in the end of the semester, we just couldn't keep up with the exams and projects submissions anymore and therefor could not achieve the expected results. While we have drafted out our functionalities well, we are missing the implementation into the code. 

### Learnings

We enjoyed working on this project nevertheless and put genuine effort into the parts that we did manage to work on. We have learnt our lesson in time management and in making more small steps throughout the semester to minimize the gap between the potential and actual realization of a project.
