## Tien Minh Nguyen - review

Helpful and communicative team member. Sometimes a bit late in giving feedback and project input.

Slow progress in the making of the app. But the communication helped knowing that we were working together towards our goal.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

Recommend asking for help earlier.
