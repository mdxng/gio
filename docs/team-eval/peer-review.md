## Tien Minh Nguyen - review 

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Helpful and communicative team member. Sometimes a bit late in giving feedback and project input.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Slow progress in the making of the app. But the communication helped knowing that we were working together towards our goal.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

Recommend asking for help earlier.

## Dao Minh Duong Nguyen - review 

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Dao Minh Duong is a great partner although she a busy person is. She works very carefully and does update me from her work from time to time.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Duo her being sometimes busy(but really just sometimes) she is hard to contact her. But she does a very well communication and has many skills that kept our project in flow. (Props to her powerpoint, and art of formatting simple word pages)

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

There is not much to say. But from both sides to start earlier and learning how to use VSCode and Github better, because towards the although the Login function worked it didn't work anymore while merging everything together or on other devices.
